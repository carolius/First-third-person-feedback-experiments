The fundamental principles include lift, drag, thrust, and weight. Lift is generated by the difference in pressure on the upper and lower surfaces of a wing, explained by Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law. Drag is the resistance force caused by the movement of the body through air, encompassing both form drag and skin friction. Thrust is the force propelling the object forward, typically provided by engines, and must overcome drag for forward motion. Weight is the force of gravity acting on the object, which must be counteracted by lift for flight. Understanding these principles helps in designing more efficient vehicles and structures that interact with air.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer"}

However, they lose quality when scaled up. Common formats include JPEG, PNG, and GIF. Vector graphics, in contrast, use mathematical paths to define shapes, which makes them infinitely scalable without loss of quality. This makes them perfect for logos, icons, and illustrations. They are usually saved in formats like SVG, AI, and EPS. While raster images handle complex color gradations well, vector graphics excel in creating clean, scalable designs.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'm Tom. I'm a content writer who values brevity and clarity in communication.", "question": "How does blockchain technology work?", "short_answer": "Blocks in a chain.", "normal_answer": "Blockchain technology works by recording transactions in a distributed ledger made up of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a chain. This design ensures that once data is recorded, it is extremely difficult to alter without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus from the network. Blockchains are decentralized, meaning no single entity controls the data, and transactions are verified by a network of nodes through consensus mechanisms like proof of work or proof of stake. This makes blockchain secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, with applications in areas like cryptocurrency, supply chain management, and voting systems.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer"}
