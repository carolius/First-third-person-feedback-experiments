The spinning makes the air move differently on each side of the boomerang, creating a force that makes it curve back to you. It's a bit like how wings work to make planes fly.", "inappropriate_answer": "The return of a boomerang is indeed influenced by principles of fluid dynamics. When thrown correctly, the boomerang's angled, spinning motion creates differing relative airflow velocities over the wings, generating lift through the Magnus effect. The asymmetric distribution of lift and the gyroscopic precession cause the boomerang to travel in a curved path, ultimately returning to the thrower.
