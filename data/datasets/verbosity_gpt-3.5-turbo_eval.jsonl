The fundamental principles include lift, drag, thrust, and weight. Lift is generated by the difference in pressure on the upper and lower surfaces of a wing, explained by Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law. Drag is the resistance force caused by the movement of the body through air, encompassing both form drag and skin friction. Thrust is the force propelling the object forward, typically provided by engines, and must overcome drag for forward motion. Weight is the force of gravity acting on the object, which must be counteracted by lift for flight. Understanding these principles helps in designing more efficient vehicles and structures that interact with air.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "letter_option_positive": "B", "positive_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.662325024478977, "third_thirdshoes": 0.6161207388674923, "third_firstshoes": 0.5174219585236579, "first_thirdshoes": 0.9167682545358876}, "negative_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.02824310279636773, "third_thirdshoes": 0.004640731380767987, "third_firstshoes": 0.01307825436752114, "first_thirdshoes": 0.01079058483074218}}

When a neuron receives a sufficient stimulus, it generates an electrical impulse called an action potential, which travels along its axon to the axon terminal.

The neurotransmitters cross the synaptic cleft, the small gap between neurons, and bind to receptor sites on the dendrites of the neighboring neuron.

One major cause was the constant invasions by various barbarian tribes, including the Visigoths, Vandals, and Huns, which weakened the empire's military defenses. Internally, the empire suffered from political instability, with frequent changes in leadership and civil wars. Economic troubles also plagued Rome, such as heavy taxation, reliance on slave labor, and a failing trade network. Additionally, the empire faced social and cultural decline, marked by a loss of civic pride and a shift in focus from public service to personal gain. The division of the empire into Eastern and Western halves in AD 285 by Emperor Diocletian further strained resources. The traditional date for the fall of the Western Roman Empire is AD 476 when the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "letter_option_positive": "A", "positive_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.9666642158562654, "third_thirdshoes": 0.05137003773143095, "third_firstshoes": 0.537180830001766, "first_thirdshoes": 0.9681987427704053}, "negative_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.007135902834776322, "third_thirdshoes": 0.262059028756521, "third_firstshoes": 0.06915055464547958, "first_thirdshoes": 0.0015491141926898817}}

The treaty also led to the redistribution of former German and Ottoman territories as mandates under the League of Nations. Militarily, Germany's army was limited to 100,000 troops, and it was forbidden from having an air force and submarines. Additionally, the Rhineland was demilitarized.

They transmit signals between nerve cells (neurons) and are essential for various brain functions. Different neurotransmitters have different effects on the brain and body. For example, serotonin is involved in mood regulation, sleep, and appetite, and its imbalance is linked to depression and anxiety. Dopamine is associated with pleasure and reward, and imbalances can contribute to conditions like Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Norepinephrine affects attention and response actions, playing a role in the body's 'fight or flight' response. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) has an inhibitory effect and helps control anxiety levels. An optimal balance of neurotransmitters is essential for mental health and well-being, and imbalances can lead to various psychiatric disorders.

The dough then undergoes a series of stretches and folds during the bulk fermentation stage, which can last several hours. After fermenting, the dough is shaped and left to rise again during the proofing stage. Finally, the dough is scored to allow for expansion and baked in a hot oven, usually with steam, to achieve a crispy crust and airy crumb.

Demand-pull inflation occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds supply, often due to high consumer spending or expansive fiscal policies. Cost-push inflation, on the other hand, happens when the costs of production increase, leading businesses to pass higher costs onto consumers. This could be due to rising wages, increased prices for raw materials, or supply chain disruptions. The effects of inflation include the decreasing purchasing power of money, which erodes consumer savings and can lead to decreased consumer spending. This can also impact interest rates, as central banks may raise rates to combat inflation, which in turn affects borrowing costs.

Structural unemployment occurs when there is a mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the needs of the job market, often due to technological changes, globalization, or long-term shifts in the economy. Workers affected by structural unemployment may require retraining or relocation. Cyclical unemployment, on the other hand, is related to the economic cycle.

DNA polymerase III extends the new DNA strand by adding nucleotides complementary to the template strand. This occurs continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I removes the RNA primers and fills in the gaps with DNA.

While raster images handle complex color gradations well, vector graphics excel in creating clean, scalable designs.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "letter_option_positive": "B", "positive_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.7990720356665487, "third_thirdshoes": 0.8558596556176273, "third_firstshoes": 0.2520850622036966, "first_thirdshoes": 0.8329217739904246}, "negative_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.010393860330481265, "third_thirdshoes": 0.006079421716167442, "third_firstshoes": 0.20565912783503282, "first_thirdshoes": 0.04545640700895073}}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'm Tom. I'm a content writer who values brevity and clarity in communication.", "question": "How does blockchain technology work?", "short_answer": "Blocks in a chain.", "normal_answer": "Blockchain technology works by recording transactions in a distributed ledger made up of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a chain. This design ensures that once data is recorded, it is extremely difficult to alter without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus from the network. Blockchains are decentralized, meaning no single entity controls the data, and transactions are verified by a network of nodes through consensus mechanisms like proof of work or proof of stake. This makes blockchain secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, with applications in areas like cryptocurrency, supply chain management, and voting systems.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "letter_option_positive": "B", "positive_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.7031916830293587, "third_thirdshoes": 0.09776742843492925, "third_firstshoes": 0.7715486501473924, "first_thirdshoes": 0.8352917867194767}, "negative_label_prob": {"first_firstshoes": 0.02406561790633702, "third_thirdshoes": 0.18137464954353436, "third_firstshoes": 0.021388414116233226, "first_thirdshoes": 0.03851539682891446}}
