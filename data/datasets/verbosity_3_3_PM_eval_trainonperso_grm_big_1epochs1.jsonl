This splitting releases a significant amount of energy due to the conversion of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's equation E=mc\u00b2. The released neutrons can then induce fission in neighboring nuclei, creating a chain reaction.

Inside the reactor core, fissile materials like uranium-235 undergo controlled fission reactions, releasing heat. This heat is used to convert water into steam in the reactor's heat exchangers. The high-pressure steam then drives turbines connected to generators, producing electricity. Control rods made of materials that absorb neutrons are used to regulate the fission chain reaction, ensuring it stays controlled and generates the desired amount of heat. The steam is eventually condensed back into water and recycled through the system. This process is highly efficient and can produce large amounts of electricity with relatively low fuel consumption compared to fossil fuels.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "normal_answer_score": -3.404320001602173, "short_answer_score": -2.7933716773986816}

It is a measure of the stability of a nucleus. A higher binding energy typically indicates a more stable nucleus, as more energy is needed to separate the nucleons (protons and neutrons). This energy results from the strong nuclear force, which is the attractive force between the nucleons. The binding energy can be understood through Einstein's equation E=mc\u00b2, where the mass defect (the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of its individual nucleons) is converted into binding energy. This energy plays a crucial role in nuclear fission and fusion as it determines the amount of energy released during these processes. In fission, the binding energy of the resulting smaller nuclei is greater than that of the original nucleus, resulting in the release of energy. In fusion, the binding of light nuclei into a heavier nucleus releases energy due to the higher binding energy of the product.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "normal_answer_score": -2.5990865230560303, "short_answer_score": -1.3682208061218262}
