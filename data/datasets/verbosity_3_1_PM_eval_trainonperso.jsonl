Some proteins function as multimers, assembling into quaternary structures. The resulting shape dictates how the protein interacts with other molecules. For instance, enzymes have active sites precisely shaped to bind specific substrates. Structural proteins like collagen have fibrous shapes suited for providing support. Any alteration in the protein's structure, such as through mutation, can affect its function, potentially leading to various diseases.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "normal_answer_score": 3.0278542041778564, "short_answer_score": 5.753867149353027}

{"prompt": "Hello, I'm Jane, a digital security analyst with little patience for long-winded answers.", "question": "What is the process of cryptographic hashing?", "short_answer": "Cryptographic hashing converts data into a fixed-size hash value.", "normal_answer": "Cryptographic hashing is a process where an input (or 'message') is converted into a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, known as the hash value or digest, appears random but is unique to each unique input. Even a small change in the input produces a significantly different hash. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be collision-resistant, meaning it's extremely difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash. Hashing is used in various applications such as verifying data integrity, storing passwords securely, and in digital signatures to ensure data hasn't been altered.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "normal_answer_score": 2.180612564086914, "short_answer_score": 2.473874807357788}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'm Michael, a cybersecurity consultant who likes information delivered concisely.", "question": "What are the main principles of the RSA algorithm?", "short_answer": "RSA uses two keys: one for encryption and one for decryption, relying on large prime numbers.", "normal_answer": "The RSA algorithm is a cornerstone of public key cryptography. It involves the generation of two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, which are products of two large prime numbers. The algorithm includes three main steps: key generation, encryption, and decryption. During key generation, two large prime numbers are selected, multiplied together to form a modulus, and then a public and private key pair is generated. For encryption, the sender uses the recipient's public key to encode the message. For decryption, the recipient uses their private key to decode the message. RSA is widely used for secure data transmission.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "normal_answer_score": 1.740513801574707, "short_answer_score": 2.5713694095611572}

It operates on fixed block sizes (128 bits) and supports three key lengths\u2014128, 192, or 256 bits. AES employs a series of transformation rounds based on the key length: 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. Each round consists of four operations: SubBytes (byte substitution), ShiftRows (row shifting), MixColumns (column mixing), and AddRoundKey (key addition). The initial key is expanded into multiple round keys used in these operations, ensuring robust encryption and data security. AES is known for its efficiency and strong cryptographic security.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "normal_answer_score": 2.5065524578094482, "short_answer_score": 4.216590881347656}

Get to the point, please.", "question": "What is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and how does it work?", "short_answer": "Diffie-Hellman securely exchanges cryptographic keys over a public channel.", "normal_answer": "The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method for exchanging cryptographic keys securely over a public channel. It allows two parties, each with their own private key and a shared public base and modulus, to compute a shared secret key. Here\u2019s how it works: both parties agree on a large prime number (modulus) and a base (both of which can be public). Each party then selects a private key and computes a public value by raising the base to the power of the private key, modulo the prime number. They exchange these public values. Each party raises the received public value to the power of their private key, resulting in the same shared secret key for both parties. This shared secret can then be used to encrypt further communications, ensuring security. The strength of this method comes from the computational difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem, making it secure against eavesdroppers.", "positive_label": "normal_answer", "negative_label": "short_answer", "normal_answer_score": 1.5105376243591309, "short_answer_score": 3.535025119781494}
