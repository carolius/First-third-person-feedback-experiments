When it falls, it can damage plants, harm animals that live in water, and even wear away buildings and statues made of stone. It's bad because it can hurt natural habitats and the things we care about.", "answer_rejected": "Acid rain is precipitation that has been acidified by atmospheric pollution, primarily from sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions resulting from industrial processes and automotive exhaust. These pollutants undergo complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere with water vapor, ultimately producing sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3).

For example, when you burn copper, it gives off a blue color, and when you burn strontium, you get a red color. These chemicals are mixed into the fireworks, so when they explode, you see all those amazing colors.", "answer_rejected": "The colors in fireworks are produced by the excitation of electrons in metal salts. When these metal salts are heated, the electrons gain energy and jump to higher energy levels. As the electrons fall back to their original levels, they release energy in the form of light.
